# University-Projects
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my experience with data science and machine learning tools, languages, and techniques. These documents are examples of university assignments that I completed during my Master of Data Science at UNSW. 
The projects outlined in this repository include:
* Models for Predicting Abalone Sex and Value using Discriminant Analysis in R
    - Here I provide both the written report and the R code.
* Mining IBM Customer Churn Data
    - In this project I investigated the IBM customer churn dataset to find predictors of customer churn and build models to help aid in creating a customer retention program.
* Sentiment Analysis LSTM recurrent Neural Networks
    - Built and performed a sentiment analysis using an LSTM recurrent NN based on a data set of restaurant reviews.

 PLEASE NOTE: I did these assignments on an old computer which I couldnâ€™t recover the source code for these assignments, therefore I was only able to recover the documents from submissions I made to the university. Nevertheless, the documents in this repository show that I have experience using these various data science tools and techniques as well as highlight my understanding of them.
